<h1>Virtual Pet Shelter AMOK!</h1>

+ At the Virtual Pet Shelter, you are responsible for caring for many animals' needs

+ Pets include organic dogs and cats and robotic dogs and cats

+ Each animal has a general health status 

+ Depending on whether they are organic or robotic, health is determined by different needs

+ Robotic Pets:

   + Robotic pets must be oiled and maintained regularly

   + These needs are on a scale of 0 - 100 (0 = perfect condition, 100 = needs work)   

   + You can take care of these needs by carrying out basic commands   

+ Organic Pets

   + Organic pets must be fed, watered, and played regularly   

   + Additionally, the cats' litterbox and dogs' cages must be cleaned or this will negatively impact health   

+ To exit the game at any time, type "quit"
